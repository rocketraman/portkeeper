portkeeper
=============================================================

Keeps a series of ports open while running. Useful to reserve ports
on a system. Ports can then be allocated to system users and then
removed from portkeeper.

Functions:

- specify port ranges or individual ports
- specify exclusions within the given port list
- periodically attempts to rebind to ports that could not be bound at startup

TODOs:

- allow modification and reporting of port range online (via command line and/or gui)
- parameterize rebind retry interval
